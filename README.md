# 4 Search Algorithms: Mathematical - Greedy - Tabu - Local

The goal of this work is to attribute events in rooms in an efficient way so that the total number of participants in all events and the total time in which the rooms are occupied are as high as possible. The exact, heuristic and metaeuristic approach are proposed, provided with a comparative analysis that illustrates which one best suits this type of problem.
On GitHub I only uploaded the code, if you are interested in the project I can provide documentation with complete statistics and the logical reasoning behind each choice made, as well as the results obtained.
